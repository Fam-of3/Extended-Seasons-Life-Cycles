bg_old_info_Alchemist,Text,,"<name> had become disillusioned questing for the Philosopher's Stone, and sought the Elixir of Youth. [He/She] could read Greek and Arabic and made copious notes in code. <name> occasionally despaired, [his/her] dreams reduced to glittering dross."
bg_old_info_Archer,Text,,"From being fostered as a squire through to becoming a mounted archer, <name> was a true career soldier. Scarred and surly, [he/she] had kept a cool head at Saint-Omer and Morlaix, escaping without victory but with [his/her] life."
bg_old_info_Architect,Text,,"If truth be told, <name> was jealous of Henry Yeverley. Although [he/she] could never rival the Master Mason of the King's Works, <name> thought [his/her] advanced ideas on architecture, acquired at the Château de Vincennes, worthy of greater renown."
bg_old_info_Armorer,Text,,"<name> began with cuir bouilli, leather boiled in wax and sturdy enough to give a commoner some battlefield protection. Later [he/she] progressed to Brigandine armour, riveting on metal plate to shield the heart. <name> was also serviceable with a bow."
bg_old_info_Armourer,Text,,"<name> could bend anything to [his/her] will, especially bright metal. Formerly apprentice to a master from Chartres, <name>'s hammer and nimble fingers had worked long years in the armouries of the London arsenal. [He/She] had saved countless lives."
bg_old_info_ArmyCook,Text,,"An army marches on its stomach, and <name> knew how to keep the campfires burning and soldier's bellies full. [His/Her] meals weren't exactly gourmet but <name> was a keen butcher, and could fillet the opposition pretty skillfuly in retreat."
bg_old_info_Arrowsmith,Text,,"Tipped with blade or barbed, <name> had been turning out arrow heads since [he/she] was 14. [He/She] sometimes wondered how many of [his/her] creations had found their mark, staining the ruddy battlefields of Sluys and Crecy."
bg_old_info_Barber,Text,,"Need a close shave? When it was time to remove a troublesome beard or festering limb, <name> would merrily oblige. [He/She] loved to gossip almost as much as letting blood. <name> was often the first to know, and, for many, the last they would see."
bg_old_info_Berner,Text,,"<name> was top dog, the leader of the pack. [He/She] cared for the hounds, and in return these dogs were fiercely loyal. Although not of high rank, <name> commanded respect. Hounds can be ferocious when crossed."
bg_old_info_Blacksmith,Text,,"Broad and taciturn, <name> believed [his/her] art helped forge Anglalonde, aided by the gods. 'Weland gave the Sword, The Sword gave the Treasure, and the Treasure gave the Law,' so it was said. And <name> repeated that often, to any who listened."
bg_old_info_Bowyer,Text,,"It was said that <name> annihilated 23 French warriors at L’Ecluse, each dispatched with a single, mercifully accurate shot. [His/Her] fame as an archer was only surpassed by <name>’s skill with yew, building fine longbows. They were greatly prized."
bg_old_info_Brewster,Text,,"You could tell <name>'s profession by [his/her] tall black hat and broomstick. Yes, [he/she] brewed ale. <name> was a grafter, and resented the Abbot's assumption that [he/she] used [his/her] wiles to get pious men drunk. You can't hold back an entrepreneur."
bg_old_info_BrickMaker,Text,,"<name> loved the slippery feeling of earth between [his/her] toes. [He/She] spent a happy childhood plugging weathered clay in the yards of Hull, forming an array of ruddy blocks destined for castles and fortresses. [He/She] was an absolute brick."
bg_old_info_Builder,Text,,"From sawn timber lintel frames to trampled cob for thick, curved walls, <name> could work them with [his/her] strong, raw hands. <name> was known to be rough and ready, just as quick to anger as to lauch into bawdy tales or raucous songs."
bg_old_info_Butcher,Text,,"<name> knew animals inside out, as befits a member of the Butcher's Guild. [He/She] had a gentle way with all beasts, and dealt their fate swiftly. <name> knows how to prepare exotic cuts fit for a king, which peasants have never tasted."
bg_old_info_Carpenter,Text,,"<name> was a member of the Brotherhood of Carpenters, a guild that offered heavenly rewards. To work all day with wood, knowing that in death the Brotherhood would pay for burial and even have prayers said at the chantry made <name> deeply thankful."
bg_old_info_Carter,Text,,"<name> got sick of shoveling dung with the reeve looking over [his/her] shoulder. And sicker still of the miserable husbandman who didn't pay fair and square in ale when <name> unloaded it onto the fields. At least [he/she] had a strong back."
bg_old_info_Chef,Text,,"Once an enfant de cuisine under the great master Taillevent, <name> became chef to the great houses of England. Despite [his/her] snobbery, there's no denying <name>'s culinary expertise regarding all manner of edible flora, fauna, and fungi."
bg_old_info_Cobbler,Text,,"Hailing from <origin>, <name> liked to roam up over the downs and through the ferny holloways of England. Villagers always welcomed [him/her], as even the most humble carl or cotter had shoes for <name> to mend. "
bg_old_info_Cordwainer,Text,,"<name> entered the Cordwainers' Guild by patrimony - 'Corio et Arte' had been [his/her] father's favourite refrain. The scent of leather revived unbidden memories of London ateliers in the shadow of St Paul's, bustling with shoemakers like <name>."
bg_old_info_Cottar,Text,,"With a field to plough and a cottage to live in, <name> laboured hard. [He/She] had mainly worried about death and taxes. With a dozen destitute dependents, <name> had feared paying out all [his/her] livestock in heriots to the Lord if any died."
bg_old_info_Courtesan,Text,,"<name> speaks soft and low, with a gentle laugh as pleasing as birdsong. Despite being a great storyteller, nobody knows [his/her] chequered history at court. However, <name> knows a tasty little secret about almost everyone else..."
bg_old_info_Engineer,Text,,"<name> took pride in the vast engines of war [he/she] designed. <name> dreamed of one day creating a device as legendary as the great Warwolf trebuchet created by Master James of St. George. How the tarbarrels and corpses would fly!"
bg_old_info_Farmer,Text,,"Though not educated, <name> was wise. [He/She] knew when to plant to avoid a frost, and could coax oxen to plough a perfect furrow. Life was hard but Nature was bountiful. <name> had much to be thankful for."
bg_old_info_Farrier,Text,,"<name> is a horse whisperer. [He/She] keeps equine hooves healthy and shod in iron. It doesn't pay much, but it's a stable job."
bg_old_info_FieldDoctor,Text,,"By day, <name> tended fallen troops. But at night, the rank threat of battlefield dysentery and marsh fever invaded [his/her] sleep. Bad air from bloated corpses was the stuff of nightmares. Of the four horsemen, <name> dreaded pestilence most."
bg_old_info_Franklin,Text,,"Tilling lynchets into the poor, hilly soil near <origin> had been a last resort as fertile land was scarce. But <name> had done well, and won the freedom to farm their own hide. <name> felt pride, but mainly relief. [He/She] soldiered on."
bg_old_info_Gardener,Text,,"<name> had found peace within the wattle fences of the garden, filled with scented flowers and herbs. [He/She] knew their properties well, as food and medicine. Time stood still under the trellises, and <name> would bathe in the scent of new growth."
bg_old_info_GraveDigger,Text,,"<name> dug the graves at <origin> churchyard. But it was on the bloodied field at Crécy that [he/she] did [his/her] finest work. To crack French skulls in a ditch hewn with the very same pickaxe gave <name> endless satisfaction."
bg_old_info_Healer,Text,,"A cloistered life, tending the abbey gardens and copying fine manuscripts, spun <name> along a golden thread of erudition. Alas, the pitiless Abbott urged [him/her] to go forth and heal the sick and the poor. So, reluctantly, <name>’s exile began."
bg_old_info_Herbalist,Text,,"Having once seen a copy of De Materia Medica at Oxford, <name> became a lifelong devotee Dioscorides. Blending this with the teachings of [his/her] mentor, an elderly nun and plantswoman, <name> felt confident in pronouncing upon botanical matters."
bg_old_info_Hunter,Text,,"They said in <origin> that <name> was born with a bow in [his/her] hand. In the warmer months, <name> would hunt wolves, [his/her] tongue lolling and eyes bright as [he/she] loped through the forest, lithe, invisible, and poised to strike."
bg_old_info_Innkeep,Text,,"<name> was known for the crustiest pie pastry in <origin>, and poured a generous pitcher of ale to boot. Jovial and fair, [he/she] never hesitated to knock a few thick heads together if fights broke out, either."
bg_old_info_Knight,Text,,"Chivalry was <name>'s lifeblood, and [he/she] would die for honour. A knight of St John, <name> had become a warrior monk, defended Rhodes from infidels. Loyalty, justice and generosity were [his/her] watchwords, but woe betide the summa culpabilis."
bg_old_info_Lorimer,Text,,"<name> has furrows of concentration etched on [his/her] brow, and brawny arms from working hammer and bellows. Whether a humble horse bit or a knight's spurs, <name> could craft them."
bg_old_info_Marshal,Text,,"A wanderer from Barcelona, <name> had the gift of healing animals, and occasionally humans at a pinch. [He/She] was learned, understanding the Moorish faith, and the teachings of Galen and Aristotle. <name> had an excellent sense of humour!"
bg_old_info_MasterBuilder,Text,,"<name> loved getting stuck into a complex project. [He/She] spent many years crossing Europe in search of instruction. <name> understood how to create gravity-defying structures with stone and iron, taught by the nameless, genius cathedral builders."
bg_old_info_Mercenary,Text,,"<name> had roamed Italy causing the worst kinds of trouble with the Company of St George, a group of freemen whose goal was pillaging and chaos. All good things must end, and <name> had subsequently dug ditches and escaped hanging for petty thievery."
bg_old_info_Miner,Text,,"<name> had done [his/her] time in the Low Peak lead fields and the Welsh mines of the Black Prince. Pale and shunning daylight like many miners, <name> had hollow eyes and headaches. Glistening veins of gold caressed [his/her] dreams."
bg_old_info_Monk,Text,,"<name> liked to potter in the still room, with [his/her] salves and potions. Those brought to the hospital were truly at the mercy of God. But <name> liked to offer what little curative help [he/she] could to ease their suffering."
bg_old_info_Nun,Text,,"<name>'s family paid the church her dowry, granting her a pious and cloistered life. Instead, a small, persistent voice bid her roam over battlefields, stitching up wounds and praying with the broken as they gasped their last. It was <name>'s calling."
bg_old_info_Peddler,Text,,"Traveller <name> carried needful supplies on [his/her] back like a snail, toiling between remote hamlets. The insular indwellers were always suspicious. Each time, <name> sweet-talked them into trusting [him/her], so that the bargaining could begin."
bg_old_info_Recruit,Text,,"<name> practiced when [he/she] could with the longbow, but ploughing and reaping duties generally took precedence. No matter, <name> was enlisted to fight in France, ending at the Siege of Tournai. A string to [his/her] bow and a tale for the fireside."
bg_old_info_Reeve,Text,,"Rising from humble serf to Reeve offered <name> a coveted place at [his/her] lord's table. Yet overseeing [his/her] fellow labourers was a thankless task. With so much to manage, why not take a little for oneself? <name> certainly felt justified."
bg_old_info_Roofer,Text,,"<name> felt that [his/her] dizzying head for heights was a divine gift, to be used in architectural celebration of Our Lord. Working among the angels on the great spire of Salisbury Cathedral was the pinnacle of [his/her] career."
bg_old_info_Scribe,Text,,"The pen is mightier than the sword, and <name> had certainly reveled in a little power. Called upon to wield [his/her] quill by merchants and gentry, <name> recorded their contracts, their laws and their deaths in littera antiqua, with a flourish."
bg_old_info_Shipwright,Text,,"<name> had done [his/her] time building vessels on the docks, and could turn [his/her] calloused hand to all manner of construction. Ports being rough and ready places, <name> also knew how to throw a punch and dodge a scoundrel's shiv."
bg_old_info_Soldier,Text,,"<name> had seen gruesome battles, weak leaders and fearsome foes. Expecting to face death in France, <name> trained constantly and was fighting fit, belligerent and always guarded. We often give our enemies the means of our own destruction."
bg_old_info_Swineherd,Text,,"Wandering the forest with rooting hogs for company, carrying a stout stick for beating down acorns and interlopers...this was all <name> knew. Whiling away the hours, chewing mushrooms, alone with [his/her] imagination. Other people's jobs were more onerous, <name> believed."
bg_old_info_Tanner,Text,,"<name> knew how to tan a hide with an animal's own brains, and with the alchemy of wood ash, excrement and festering bark. Without <name>, no one would have shoes, armour or saddles. But [he/she] was hardly popular. As jobs go, <name>'s really stank."
bg_old_info_Wheelwright,Text,,"<name> of <origin> believed there were many spokes in the wheel of life. [He/She] enjoyed lending a hand with repairs and building projects, even fashioning a crucifix at the behest of a group of mummers for their mystery play."

bg_recent_info_Accurate,Text,,"<name> began to perform a sideshow, throwing daggers in an arc over a pretty girl for a few coins. <name> figured out [he/she] had a talent when [he/she] threw a carving knife dead into the eye of a looter. <name> never misses."
bg_recent_info_Ambitious,Text,,"<name> crept about Oxford, tearing pages glowing with illuminations, swiping vellum and ink. <name> served [his/her] masters in the scriptorium dilligently. <name> had a steady hand. <name> would learn to read and write, and finally become Somebody."
bg_recent_info_Apostate,Text,,"<name> was drawn to The Circle of Avalon. <name> had secretly despised sheepish, obedient Christians, and was relieved that others felt the same. [He/She] dreamed of Arthur’s imminent return from under the faerie hill, now that the purge was over."
bg_recent_info_Artful,Text,,"<name> chose eternal damnation over living purgatory. [He/She] sold the cow, then [his/her] only daughter. An artful beggar, [he/she] roamed the tattered shires, flattering, cajoling and seducing for a crust of bread. <name> is a survivor."
bg_recent_info_AvantGarde,Text,,"<name> experimented. Have you tried rat au vin or eels in goat's milk? Neither had <name> until Armageddon. [He/She] was utterly fearless in combining random ingredients to keep everyone fed, leading to unexpected results and frequent indigestion."
bg_recent_info_Bloodthirsty,Text,,"<name> recalled the healer lancing boils. Flagstones had run red as he opened veins, cursing the French, and the King. Finally <name> took the powders and purifying herbs from the dying healer's blackened hand. <name> was left holding the bloody razor."
bg_recent_info_Bookish,Text,,"studying the many great works in the libraries of Oxford gave <name> confidence to try [his/her] hand at medicine. <name> was from a worthy family, the last of [his/her] name. Book learning surely surpasses base peasant cures, herbs and charms?"
bg_recent_info_Brutal,Text,,"<name> had fallen from grace, ending up in prison. Fate in the form of The Great Mortality - sickened guards and a filched key - offered a window of escape. <name> now had an unhealthy fascination with torture and tools of punishment."
bg_recent_info_Caring,Text,,"there was no one to tend to the animals. Hogs ran wild. Cattle starved in the winter fields. It was after <name> came upon a lifeless mare beside her newborn foal that [he/she] decided to shepherd whatever beasts were needful."
bg_recent_info_Charitable,Text,,"<name> roved among the mills, begging or stealing flour to bake bread. This [he/she] made into simple bannocks and distributed to the starving village folk, barely clinging to the wreckage of their former lives. It kept <name> busy, and purposeful."
bg_recent_info_Cheerful,Text,,"<name> would whistle as [he/she] worked, almost as though the horrors of recent times had passed [him/her] by. <name>'s reason to be cheery was simple enough. [He/She] had caught the pestilence, but had dodged the Grim Reaper. Life was good."
bg_recent_info_Chivalrous,Text,,"<name> swooned over the histories of Sir Gawain and Sir Bedivere. To be so gallant, so merciful. <name> thought [he/she] had the right qualities to be a knight. And those qualities were sorely needed, in these savage days."
bg_recent_info_Clever,Text,,"<name> believed [him/her]self spared from Mortal Sickness for a higher purpose. So said the Canterbury Friar, who taught [him/her] to read. “Knowledge is freedom”, <name> whispered softly, mounting the Friar’s mule and stealing away into the darkness."
bg_recent_info_Confident,Text,,"the noble's marches and forests became pretty much fair game. So <name> now poaches with impunity. [He/She] will catch what you want to order: venison, boar, rabbit, peacock. Naturally, this comes at a price."
bg_recent_info_Crafty,Text,,"<name> was scavenging from a bloated corpse, and came by a fine pair of shears. Trimming cloth from dead limbs was easy. Turning it into wearable garments took more practice. But <name> persisted. Now [he/she] can fashion a suit from almost anything."
bg_recent_info_Cunning,Text,,"<name> burned the putrid remains of [his/her] kin. [He/She] then followed the old grandmother deep into the forest. The cunning wicche knew every leaf, berry and fungus. <name> became fluent in the untamed language of the wild wood. "
bg_recent_info_Deadly,Text,,"<name> was on a crusade to wipe out pretentious, usurping commoners and reinstate the true and righteous order of England. Blood mattered, and <name> would reclaim [his/her] birthright. The peasantry needed to be brought to their filthy knees."
bg_recent_info_Desolate,Text,,"<name> wanted to hit someone, to take out [his/her] rage at the horror and desolation that had violated everything [he/she] loved. But <name> was a pacifist. So [he/she] hacked spoils from the bountiful earth until [his/her] grief was spent instead."
bg_recent_info_Despicable,Text,,"<name> took to the hills on a rampage as order crumbled. Born to privilege, <name> gathered a vile band of ruffians and killed and burned at will. [He/She] was exhilarated by chaos, amused by desecration, and not to be underestimated."
bg_recent_info_Faithless,Text,,"the priest beseeched <name> to repair <origin> church, despite the sickly season. [He/She] watched gloomily as the congregation gradually expired, sneezing as they broke bread together, and buried their brethren. God is dead, <name> thought."
bg_recent_info_Hopeful,Text,,"<name> fished leeches from the pond at <origin>, and carried them about in a milk jar, offering healing. <name> had no experience whatsoever, but had once seen a monk put the beasts on a dying man. It probably did no harm, <name> thought."
bg_recent_info_Inconspicuous,Text,,"<name> was deployed undercover to watch for heresy among royalist factions. On receiving no further instructions from [his/her] Master of Whispers, <name> sought the shadows, using what [he/she] heard to survive."
bg_recent_info_Loyal,Text,,"<name> pledged fealty to King Edmund, who was ordained to rule and bring England back into harmony and balance. <name> would gladly put anyone who disagreed with [him/her] to the sword. Death would be swift and merciful."
bg_recent_info_Patient,Text,,"<name> developed patience to sit in a furze bush or atop an oak tree, chewing on a blade of grass and listening to the wind. At the perfect moment, [he/she] would take down [his/her] prey with a single arrow. <name> had become an assassin."
bg_recent_info_Penitent,Text,,"<name> acquired a cap marked with a red cross. It was a memento of months spent marching naked, one behind the other. Each whipped their naked, bleeding bodies with scourges spiked with nails. 'God is merciful, God is just', they wept."
bg_recent_info_Reckless,Text,,"<name> ventured into the abandoned mines, with a band of comrades and a few candle stubs. It only takes a pickaxe, any fool can do it, <name> supposed. And putting aside the fatal rockfall and the flooding incidents, <name> was right."
bg_recent_info_Rustic,Text,,"<name> had learned to survive on foraged hedgerow fare, supplemented with the occasional stolen egg or trapped hare. <name> could make a meal from dandelion, primroses or stewed acorns. [His/Her] eyes were painful hollows, always hungry."
bg_recent_info_Ruthless,Text,,"<name> recalled townsfolk dying in the streets as the nobles fled north to escape the plague. Are we not all mere sinners in the eyes of God? <name> would follow William of York in defending the rights of common folk. To the death if necessary."
bg_recent_info_Savage,Text,,"<name> had utterly lost [his/her] mind. <name> had seen Beelzebub and there was no redemption. [He/She] could make shelter, and fire, and dream of blood and screams. <name> would not, or could not, say if [he/she] had eaten human flesh."
bg_recent_info_Shrewd,Text,,"circumstances could have been better, but [he/she] made the most of it. When <name> took to whittling amulets to ward against the Mortal Corruption, in a number of shapes to appeal to christians, jews or pagans, [he/she] got rich, fast."
bg_recent_info_Solitary,Text,,"<name> had felt more at home in the quiet of the clay pits and lime kilns than in the towns. There were traces of humanity, but not the stench or the despair. <name> carved a secret labyrinth into the rock, invoking memories of Reims Cathedral."
bg_recent_info_Soothsaying,Text,,"<name> lived by the lore of oak, ash and thorn, trying to ignore the collapse of civilisation and seeking solace among the trees. [He/She] waited beneath hazel and hawthorn, listening for whispers from the fey folk. Sometimes, <name> was rewarded."
bg_recent_info_Spinning,Text,,"<name> learned all about flax, for clothing, bedding, bread sacks, ropes and oil. [He/She] was soothed by retting and rolling, scutching and spinning. <name> had a steady hand, and eyes the pale, flaxen blue of a cloudless, summer sky."
bg_recent_info_Swindling,Text,,"<name> raided barns for stray kittens and pups, fashioning brightly-coloured sacks from dead-men's cloaks to stash them in. Off to market! Jiggety jig. <name> would sell the unwary a pre-bagged 'piglet,' at bargain price...and vanish. Caveat emptor!"
bg_recent_info_Tempered,Text,,"<name> had packed [his/her] surviving children on a cart and fled. [He/She] could not remain, as the ghosts of [his/her] family would haunt the house for eternity. <name> found a niche as an ironmonger. Even the unhinged need new locks and bolts."
bg_recent_info_Thoughtless,Text,,"<name> fancied [him/her]self a dressmaker. And so [he/she] set about using miller's floursacks, sheets and linen rags to clothe the destitute orphans and wastrels of <origin>. A frightful sight they were, shorn of their remaining dignity. "
bg_recent_info_Thrifty,Text,,"<name> had left the silent streets of <origin> with a cart, and started collecting metal. From churches to manors, <name> stripped them clean and melted it all down. Sir Hugh Gaveston and William of York would surely be needing swords."
bg_recent_info_Tireless,Text,,"<name> got the knack of carpentry fashioning coffins for plague victims, later nailing whole families into their homes to die. Next, <name> built trebuchets in the War of Succession. Fac et aliquid operis, ut semper te diabolus inveniat occupatum!"
bg_recent_info_Toxic,Text,,"<name> fed a band of hungry marauders, a risky job. <name> would occasionaly cut corners to save time. Uncertain if it was a stray toadstool or mouldering rye that caused the hallucinations, <name> still maintained [he/she] did [his/her] best."
bg_recent_info_Uprooted,Text,,"<name> despaired. Seeing villagers die was bad, watching the <origin> sheep succumb was catastrophic. <name> did [his/her] best to ease their suffering - slitting their throats at any sign of infection. Without livestock or livelihood, <name> fled."
bg_recent_info_Weary,Text,,"<name> was tired, truth be told. [His/Her] joints ached and [he/she] couldn't fathom how The End of Days had passed [him/her] by. <name> still oiled [his/her] blades, strangely envious of comrades slain at Saint-Omer. Somehow, <name> soldiered on."
bg_recent_info_Wicked,Text,,"<name> regretted wishing death on [his/her] father's house. This very fate befell all [his/her] kin, and <name> was filled with remorse. [He/She] took up [his/her] father's hammer, and fired up the forge. Each metallic blow rang out: ""Guilty, guilty."""
bg_recent_info_Willful,Text,,"bards told of how <name> commanded the barring of the gates, deaf to the pitiful wails and scrabbling outside. By sheer force of will, <name> kept extinction at bay in <origin>. That day, <name> became a legendary leader."
bg_recent_info_Winsome,Text,,"[he/she] became the Earl's lover. <name> had comforted him as his wife lay dying, and coerced him with blackmail when the countess unexpectedly recovered. <name> become a puppet master to the hapless Earl, his wife relegated to a distant tower."
bg_recent_info_Yorkist,Text,,"<name> thought it was bleeding obvious that the royals were to blame, cutting England to the bone because of their silly French war. [He/She] had pitched in willingly to help shore up York's defenses. Someone had to make a stand."

You can easily give feedback while in the game by hitting <style=Shortcut> F10 </style> and capturing the moment.\n\nPlease share your feedback and thoughts on our <style=Shortcut> Discord server </style> in the Beta channels there.

pseudonym_info_Apostle,Text,,"<name> was a follower alright, and loved to go on about the scriptures. [His/Her] proselytising could become a little tiresome and repetitive. When <name> wouldn't shut up, they called [him/her] 'The Apostle'. <name> thought it was a complement."
pseudonym_info_Bard,Text,,"<name> had the voice of an angel and the memory of a druid. [His/Her] spellbinding tales and sweet lullabies earned <name> the honorary title of 'minstrel'."
pseudonym_info_Bastard,Text,,"An apologist for the Philosophers of the Natural Order, <name> harboured a nagging fear that wherever [his/her] errant father was, he might be a follower of Gregorius, or even a cannibal. <name>'s friends called [him/her] 'bastard' and made it worse."
pseudonym_info_Bold,Text,,"<name> once took on three pirates after drinking for a day and a night. No one remembers if [he/she] prevailed through bravery or foolhardiness, but the legend lives on."
pseudonym_info_Bonesetter,Text,,"<name> had first practiced on animals but soon moved on to human subjects. The way [he/she] hovered [his/her] hands over the damaged limb before giving a sudden, brisk wrench was almost mystical. <name> could not explain how [he/she] did it."
pseudonym_info_Bride,Text,,"<name> seemed to be forever stitching away at incredibly fine and delicate items of clothing and linens for [his/her] wedding trousseau. [He/She] became dewy eyed at the prospect of marriage. What a pity, then, that <name> had never even been kissed."
pseudonym_info_Broken,Text,,"It was said that <name>'s adventuring career came to an abrupt end when [he/she] took an arrow to the knee. [He/She] does have a funny walk."
pseudonym_info_Butcher,Text,,"<name> wasn’t particularly smart nor talented, so each summer, around Pentecost, [his/her] parents sent [him/her] to help Uncle Aldwin at the livestock farm. <name> proved adept at slitting throats. [He/She]’s been known as 'The Butcher' ever since."
pseudonym_info_Chaste,Text,,"<name> is pining for a dead lover, and will never marry another. <name> is living in the past, trying to stop precious memories from slipping away, and shuns all affection."
pseudonym_info_Chou,Text,,"<name> spent so long in the vegetable garden as a child that [his/her] mother, of Norman stock, affectionately called [him/her] 'cabbage', as is the French way. To this day, <name> still has a green thumb, especially for brassicas."
pseudonym_info_Confessor,Text,,"<name> will solemnly unburden [him/her]self of a long list of [his/her] slain victims, in minute and sometimes tedious detail. Nobody really wants to hear it."
pseudonym_info_Crow,Text,,"Some folk still left bread and milk out for the fairy folk, a custom as old as the very hills. <name> would swoop in and gobble these up, the wiley old bird."
pseudonym_info_Cuckold,Text,,"It was well known that <name>'s spouse was unfaithful, and <name> didn't seem willing or able to do anything about it. Once a beaten, unwanted child, <name> was perfectly content to gather up whatever crumbs of affection [he/she] could salvage."
pseudonym_info_Deceiver,Text,,"As a sailor, <name> offered safe passage to desperate townsfolk attempting to flee the Tide of Death to the Western Isles or Hibernia. Once out at sea, <name> tossed them overboard, stripping their valuables. 'It's just business', <name> shrugged."
pseudonym_info_Doctor,Text,,"<name> had saved a friend's life at just 10 years old, earning the title of 'doctor'. Less well known was that <name> had abandoned many beseeching patients during the unremitting horror of The Pestilence. It was a title burdened with secret shame."
pseudonym_info_Fool,Text,,"<name> had at one time played the fool at court, and revelled in being allowed to insult the high and mighty, as long as [he/she] caused enough mirth to compensate. [His/Her] cutting wit and humourous insults were unsurpassed."
pseudonym_info_Forlorn,Text,,"When not complaining, <name> was weeping into [his/her] pottage. This was destinctly unappetising. It did not pay to ask <name> why [he/she] was forlorn, since [his/her] tales of woe were so distressing they would haunt your dreams forever."
pseudonym_info_Ghost,Text,,"<name> was pale and silent and loitered in dark alcoves. <name> seldom spoke, and often seemed to appear out of nowhere, startling people. <name> was actually a bit creepy, seeming to have more in common with the dead than the living."
pseudonym_info_Hanged,Text,,"It is told that <name> survived death by hanging. As the hangman pulled the lever and the rope jerked, <name> expected the end. But the rope suddenly snapped. As God willed it, some said, crossing themselves."
pseudonym_info_Heretic,Text,,"<name> speaks of the God of Abraham and the mosques of the Moors, of sacred groves, lost scrolls and forbidden rites. <name> knows a bit too much for [his/her] own good."
pseudonym_info_Kitten,Text,,"Cute, soft, endearing...<name> is certainly adorable, and people flock to [him/her] to pet [him/her]. But beware, <name> also has claws, and often leaves a trail of destruction behind [him/her]."
pseudonym_info_Lamb,Text,,"<name> was docile and sweet-tempered, and so was often affectionately called lamb. Like most of [his/her] disposition, <name> had learned the hard way to be on guard against wolves."
pseudonym_info_Lucky,Text,,"<name> was born under a lucky horseshoe, so they said. It seemed plausible enough. Money seemed to fall in [his/her] lap, chance encounters led to romance, and the sun always shone on <name>."
pseudonym_info_Pagan,Text,,"<name> spoke to plants and buried strange parcels in the woods under the full moon. Nobody dared speak up against [him/her] due to rumours <name> could hex them. <name> did not care that other humans called [him/her] 'Pagan'. Humans were the problem."
pseudonym_info_Paramour,Text,,"Ugly as a child, <name> would never slight a lady for her looks. And in the wake of Armageddon, the value of good looks as currency was somewhat diminished. <name> helped keep spirits - and skirts - high, gaining a reputation as a satisfying lover."
pseudonym_info_Philosopher,Text,,"<name> once read half a thing, somewhere, maybe, about turning lead into gold. Apparently urine is involved. [He/She] may be taking the piss."
pseudonym_info_Pirate,Text,,"<name> didn’t do much to deserve [his/her] nickname, [he/she] inherited it. <name> was from a long line of swashbucklers known for attacking and looting trading ships in the waters around British Isles. <name>, however, didn't sail, and couldn't swim."
pseudonym_info_Prodigal,Text,,"<name> was a quitter, [he/she] left many a task unfinished. And yet with [his/her] silver tongue, loaded with sweet flattery and plausible excuses, <name> would be welcomed back for seemingly infinite second chances."
pseudonym_info_Pudding,Text,,"<name> could make an excellent fygey pudding, among other desserts. [He/She] never lacked for paramours, being bonny and sweet, with just enough spice. Lovers, rivals and jilted exes all called <name> 'pudding', with varying degrees of affection."
pseudonym_info_Rebel,Text,,"<name> is young at heart. <name> likes to joke around and play the fool. [He/She] avoids responsibility at all costs, laughing at [his/her] elders."
pseudonym_info_Red,Text,,"The world had changed, and so had <name>. Having nothing more to lose, [he/she] joined a group of marauding bandits, and was soon their leader. Insatiable bloodlust in various assaults and squirmishes soon earned <name> a nickname 'The Red'."
pseudonym_info_Riddler,Text,,"Some people talk straight. But <name> had a way with words that certainly sounded clever, but was also a trifle confusing. Many of <name>'s pronouncements could have multiple meanings. [His/Her] friends called [him/her] The Riddler."
pseudonym_info_Saint,Text,,"<name> was not averse to nursing lepers and other outcasts, but it was to the animal kingdom that [he/she] felt the deepest afinity. <name> blushed and demured when likened to St Francis, but the comparison was apt."
pseudonym_info_Spear_Maiden,Text,,"<name> is like a fierce valkyrie from the times of the norsemen. [She] is fearless in the face of death, wild with the bloodlust of battle. They call her shieldmaiden."
pseudonym_info_Spy,Text,,"<name> had once been bribed by the abbot to listen for compromising secrets at the manor of <origin>. Alas [he/she] had been exposed and disavowed by all concerned. <name> was a pretty useless spy, but to this day, nobody trusted [him/her]."
pseudonym_info_Tart,Text,,"<name> was not in the least flirtatious. [He/She] got [his/her] nickname thanks to an acerbic nature, that left a bitter taste even after the briefest of interactions. <name> was the ultimate sourpuss."
pseudonym_info_Thief,Text,,"<name> had always been nimble fingered, but became a full-time thief to survive the Dark Years. [He/She] stitched many hidden pockets into [his/her] clothes and would pinch anything that wasn't nailed down. <name> was often hired to do so."
pseudonym_info_Wakeful,Text,,"<name> could never sleep, so [he/she] gained a reputation as a good watchman. [His/Her] night vision was highly tuned."
pseudonym_info_Zealot,Text,,"<name> keeps making altars and offerings, stopping the day's business to say prayers and muttering about sin. One might be forgiven for saying [he/she] takes it a bit far."
